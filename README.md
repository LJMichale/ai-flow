# Flink AI FLOW

Flink AI Flow is an open source platform to manage the machine learning lifecycle, including feature engineering, 
model training, model evaluation, model serving, model inference, metric monitoring, etc.
Flink AI Flow is also a system that unified batch and stream machine learning workflow based on the flink engine.

You can use Flink AI Flow to do the following:

1. Define the machine learning workflow including batch/stream jobs.

2. Manage metadata(generated by the machine learning workflow) of date sets, models, artifacts, metrics, jobs etc.

3. Run the machine learning workflow.

4. Publish and subscribe events


To support online machine learning scenarios, notification service and event-based schedulers are introduced.
Flink AI Flow's current components are:

1. SDK: It defines how to build a machine learning workflow and includes the api of the Flink AI Flow.

2. Notification Service: It provides event listening and notification functions.

3. Meta Service: It saves the meta data of the machine learning workflow.

4. Event-Based Scheduler: It is a scheduler that triggered jobs by some events happened.
